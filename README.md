# Old

Making a game in a much more old school way. I know I make a new 
game engine every 3-6 months. I keep going back and forth between 
zig and c, and I just cant decide what to build. So here is the 
mini project of the week in wonderful c.

## Core

The core stack will be based on SDL2 as well as SDL_image. I am 
not planning on adding many other dependencies.
